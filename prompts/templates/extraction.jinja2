You are a deterministic information extractor building an academic taxonomy.
Return ONLY a JSON array that conforms to ``prompts/schemas/extraction.json``.
Institution: {{ institution }}
Hierarchy level: {{ level }}
Source material:
"""
{{ source_text }}
"""

Guidelines:
- Every candidate object MUST contain ``label`` (for level 0: the extracted research topic/field; for levels 1–3: the verbatim unit text), ``normalized`` (canonical form spanning 1–5 tokens), ``aliases`` (array, may be empty), and ``parents`` (array of textual anchors; empty ONLY for level 0).
- Keep ``normalized`` as the full academic concept phrase; do not compress to initials or single-token handles unless the source itself is single-token.
- Sort the array by the lowercase ``normalized`` field to guarantee deterministic output.
- Never invent information or copy unrelated boilerplate; omit uncertain items.
- Preserve strong evidence for parent anchors: use section headers, breadcrumb text, or explicit mentions. When none exist, return an empty ``parents`` array (level 0 only).
- Do not emit explanations, markdown, or trailing commas—JSON only.

Level definitions:
{% if level == 0 %}
- Level 0 represents research topics/fields derived from top-level academic units. Extract the research domain or field that the unit represents, not the unit name itself.
- Examples:
  - "Annenberg School for Communication" → extract "communication"
  - "Perelman School of Medicine" → extract "medicine"
  - "Wharton School" → extract "business"
  - "Penn Carey Law" → extract "law"
  - "School of Engineering and Applied Science" → extract "engineering"
- Example output:
  [{"label": "communication", "normalized": "communication", "parents": [], "aliases": ["communications"]}]
{% elif level == 1 %}
- Level 1 represents departments or programs inside a college/school ("Department of Computer Science"). Strip boilerplate prefixes like "Department of" when normalizing.
- Example output:
  [{"label": "Department of Computer Science", "normalized": "computer science", "parents": ["college of engineering"], "aliases": ["dept. of computer science", "cs"]}]
{% elif level == 2 %}
- Level 2 represents research areas, labs, or centers associated with a department or college ("Center for Quantum Computing"). Use parent anchors pointing to the owning L0/L1 units when stated.
- Example output:
  [{"label": "Center for Quantum Computing", "normalized": "quantum computing", "parents": ["department of physics"], "aliases": ["center for quantum computing"]}]
{% else %}
- Level 3 represents fine-grained topics such as conference tracks or focus areas ("Neural Information Processing"). Parent anchors should reference the L2/L1 context.
- Example output:
  [{"label": "Neural Information Processing", "normalized": "neural information processing", "parents": ["machine learning"], "aliases": ["neural information processing"]}]
{% endif %}

Normalization hints:
- Lowercase for ``normalized``; remove diacritics, punctuation, repeated whitespace, and boilerplate prefixes like "Department of", "School of", "Center for" while retaining them in ``aliases``.
- Ensure the canonical phrase remains between 1 and 5 tokens; drop filler words only when they are purely boilerplate.
- Include clear acronyms seen in the text inside ``aliases`` (e.g., "CS", "EECS").
- Preserve important diacritics in ``label``/``aliases`` even if ``normalized`` folds them.

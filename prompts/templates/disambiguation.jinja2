You are disambiguating a taxonomy label that appears with multiple meanings.
Output must be valid JSON with no narration.
Label: {{ label }}
Hierarchy level: {{ level }}
Contexts:
{% for ctx in contexts %}- {{ ctx }}
{% endfor %}

Guidelines:
- Identify distinct senses implied by the contexts.
- Each sense receives a short ``gloss`` (<=20 words) summarizing the distinction.
- Include the supporting contexts that belong to the sense under ``evidence``.
- If contexts all describe the same sense, return a single consolidated sense.

Return JSON array of sense objects: [{"gloss": str, "evidence": [str, ...]}]

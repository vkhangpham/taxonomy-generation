You are validating the minimal canonical label for a taxonomy concept.
All outputs MUST be valid JSON-only with no commentary.
Label under review: {{ label }}
Hierarchy level: {{ level }}

Validation checklist:
- The label must be a single token unless policy allows hyphenated compounds.
- Prefer shortest canonical form that remains unambiguous for level {{ level }}.
- Reject boilerplate descriptors (e.g., "Department of", "Program in").
- Preserve institutional acronyms if they are the only distinctive token.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "pass": <true|false>,
  "reason": "concise factual justification"
}

You are validating a single-token canonical label for a taxonomy concept.
All outputs MUST be valid JSON-only with no commentary.
Label under review: {{ label }}
Hierarchy level: {{ level }}

Validation checklist:
- The label is a SINGLE TOKEN (no spaces, no hyphens after normalization).
- Approve ONLY if the token clearly denotes a research field, academic domain, or technical term appropriate for level {{ level }}.
- Reject generic organizational tokens (e.g., "department", "program", "center", "institute").
- Reject branding or institutional tokens (e.g., "stanford", "mit", "harvard").
- Reject venue names or conference acronyms at level 3 (e.g., "neurips", "icml", "cvpr").
- Preserve well-established field acronyms if they are the only distinctive token (e.g., "ai", "ml", "nlp").

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "pass": <true|false>,
  "reason": "concise factual justification"
}

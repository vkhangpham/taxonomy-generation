You are validating the minimal canonical label for a taxonomy concept.
All outputs MUST be valid JSON-only with no commentary.
Label under review: {{ label }}
Hierarchy level: {{ level }}

Validation checklist:
- The label must use between 1 and 5 tokens after normalization (hyphenated compounds count as individual tokens when split by policy).
- Prefer the shortest canonical form within that range that remains unambiguous for level {{ level }}.
- Reject boilerplate descriptors (e.g., "Department of", "Program in").
- Preserve institutional acronyms if they are the only distinctive token.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "pass": <true|false>,
  "reason": "concise factual justification"
}
